# TIME - Threat Intellicence Management & Enrichment
TIME is a spin-off project of [OSTrICa](https://github.com/Ptr32Void/OSTrICa),
 a threat intelligence tool written in python 2.7.

The main differences between TIME and OSTrICa are:
 * Runs on python 3, as python 2 will soon be out of support.
 * Case management, via a web interface (to be implemented)
 * More modular. Adding plug-ins should not require any modifications in the source code
 * Multiple hops. Instead of only jumping one hop away, TIME investigates the next hops as well.

**Note:** This tool is still under development. Documentation will be added in a later stage.
